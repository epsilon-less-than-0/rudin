This project is founded in the idea that mathematics, and resources for
learning mathematics, should be available to all. While Walter Rudin'
\emph{Principles of Mathematical Analysis} is a beautiful book, there are many
points in the book that may be unclear, especially to individuals first
leanring analysis. It if of course, \emph{extremely} important when learning
mathematics, or any subject for that matter, to struggle through material. That
said, the point at which struggle is helpful, is different for each individual.
We find the level of struggle expected by Rudin, to be somewhat higher than is
helpful for most new students to analysis, and also just for mathematics.

We hope that this book can serve as a great analysis book, as Rudin has
written, but with a slighlty lower level of struggle expected. We hope we can
provide more intuition and maybe some more figures than Rudin does.\todo{talk
more about who we expect to read this and what its main purpose is. a first
book for analysis? a book to read WITH Rudin?}
