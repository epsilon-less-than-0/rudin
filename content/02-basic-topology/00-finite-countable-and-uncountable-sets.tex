\section{Finite, Countable, and Uncountable Sets}
\label{sec:finite-countable-and-uncountable-sets}
Armed with a well-constructed real number system, we can begin to talk about
some mathematical constructions.  One of the simplest constructions
(operations?) on the real numbers is the object called a function.  A function
is simply a rule that assigns an input number and outputs a number. 

However, note that the notion of a function is not
constrained to operations on numbers. It can make as much sense to talk about a 
function on an arbitrary set, and the ``outputs'' need not even resemble the 
inputs in any shape or form. For example, one can define a function on the set
of names of people in a class, which outputs the birthday of the person in
binary. To make things less confusing, we will usually call this type of 
``general functions'' between sets a mapping, and reserve the term function for 
functions in the usual sense on numbers. However, one should keep in mind that
in mathematics the two terms are often used interchangeably.

In our example, we would call the set of names the domain of the function, and
the set of all possible dates the range of the function, and we say the
function maps from the domain to the range. If we denote $f$ as the funciton,
the domain as the set $A$, the range as the set $B$, then we represent this as
\[
f:A\rightarrow B
\]
Now one might notice that in a typical classroom, it is unlikely that we will
have all the possivle dates in a year represented among all the students,
unless this is an unusially large classroom, and we are sufficiently lucky.
Therefore, not all of the elements of $B$ are ``hit'' by the funciton. If it is
the case we do ``hit'' all of $B$, then we call such a function a surjection
(or and onto function). 

\begin{definition}
A mapping $f:A\rightarrow B$ is said to be a surjection, or a surjective
mapping, if for all $y\in B$, there exists an element $x\in A$, such that
$f(x) = y$.
\end{definition}

Sometimes, we are interested in talking about the values of a subset of the
domain under the mapping. For example, we may only wish to observe the
birthdays of males in the classroom. In this case, suppose $E \subset A$ is a
subset of $A$, then we say $f(E)$ is the image of $E$ under $f$, where $f(E)$
consists of all the values of the elements of $E$.

In such a way we can alternatively define a surjective mapping as one where
$f(A) = B$ (a non-seurjective mapping would only satisfy $f(A) \subset B$.

On the other hand, we can fix some subset of the range $B$, and consider the
elements in $A$ that ``hit'' $B$. To make it precise, if $G \subset B$, then we
denote $f^{-1}(E)$, the inverse image of $G$, as the set of all $x\in A$, such
that $f(x)\in G$. It is entirely possible that multiple people may have the
same birthday, so given an element $y\in B$, the set $f^{-1}(y)$, that is all
$x\in A$ that map to $y$ may have multiple elements. However, it is not
possible for a person to have multiple birthdays; in the same way, for any
$x\in A$, $f(x)$ is a single value. This is inherent in the definition of a
function.

In the special case that we do not have more than one element of the domain 
mapping to the same element of the range, i.e. we have no-one sharing the same
birthday, then we call this function an injection.

\begin{definition}
A mapping $f:A\rightarrow B$ is said to be an injection, or an injective
mapping, if for all $x_1, x_2 \in A$, whenever it is the case that $x_1\neq
x_2$, we have $f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)$.
\end{definition}

The definition says that, whenever we have distinct $x$'s in the domain, this
must mean that they map to different $y$'s in the domain. This is exactly what
we meant by no-body from the classroom having the same birthday.

Now if we have a mapping that is both surjective and injective, we call such a
ma pping a bijection, or a bijective mapping

\begin{definition}
A mapping $f:A\rightarrow B$ is said to be a bijection, or a bijective mapping,
if it is both a surjection, and an injection.
\end{definition} 

Intuitively, a bijection is a mapping that does not miss anything in the range
(surjective); and assigns each distinct $x$ from the domain, to a distinct and
unique $f(x)$ (injective). 

The following diagrams illustrate a surjection, injection, and a bijection.

The existence of a bijective mapping between two sets is useful since we are
assured that the two have the same number of elements.  (you should convince
yourself why this is the case). In fact, this is exactly how we properly
compare the number of elements between sets. If we can find a bijective mapping
between set $A$ and set $B$, then they have the same number of elements; if
there exist no bijective mapping, then the two must have diff erent number of
elements. 

In set theoretic terms, two sets have the same cardinality, or the same
cardinal number, if they have the same number of elements.

\begin{definition}
If there exists a bijective mapping between sets $A$ and $B$, we say they are 
equivalent. And we write $A \sim B$.
\end{definition}

Thus, we have a particular way of comparing two sets. If we are given two sets,
we can have a well-defined notion of what we mean when we say ``they have the
same number of elements'', or ``they do not have the same number of elements''.
A ``comparison'' such as the one described, gives us a ``relation'' between
sets. $A$ and $B$ are equivalent, if they have the same cardinality

OK THIS PART I HAVENT FIGURED OUT A WAY TO DO IT, IT'S ON EQUIV. RELATIONS

With a well-defined way of comparing the number of elements of a set, we can
begin to define what it means to have finite, or infinite, number of elements.

Intuitively, if a set were to have a finite number of elements, we ought to be 
able to count the elements one by one, and finish at some number $n$, which we
call the ``number of elements that this set has''. 

What exactly are we doing when we ``count'' the elements of a set $A$? We are
grabbing elements out of $A$, and tagging it with a unique number ($1, 2, 3, 4,
5, \ldots$), and throwing the ``element-number'' pair into the ``counted''
bucket. We continue until we run out of elements, and then we take the number
on the last pair, and call that the cardinality, or the number of elements.
This ``counting'' operation is precisely a bijective mapping between $A$, and
the counting numbers, or Natural Numbers, which are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
\ldots$. And when we say set $A$ has cardinality $n$, we mean precisely the
following:\todo{@kevin, notice that you use quite a bit of quotes in the past
few paragraphs. perhaps some italicized? also learn how to do quotes in latex}
\[
A \sim \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\ldots, n\}
\]
The existence of such an $n$, that is to say, our counting terminates, is
exactly the definition of a set being finite.  While the absence of such an $n$
is exactly the definition of a set being infinite. 

We summarize these defininitions this below. In addition, we hint at the
existence of sets which are infinite but are not equiavlent to the set of all
natural numbers. That is to say there are sets which cannot form a bijection
with some set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ but also cannot form a bijection with the
set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}$.  (This might seem like a big surprise, but think
back to Chapter 1, when we convinced you that the rational numbers is not a
``big'' enough number system)

\begin{definition}
For simplicity, we write the set $\{1, 2, 3,\ldots, n\}$ as $J_n$\todo{i really
dont like this notation. I would prefer $\overline{n}$ or something else}, and
the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}$ as $\N$. Then for any set $A$, we say
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A$ is finite if $A \sim J_n$ for some $n$ (the empty set is also
        considered to be finite, even though technically it has zero elements).
    \item $A$ is infinite if $A$ is not finite.
    \item $A$ is countable if $A \sim J$
    \item $A$ is uncountable if $A$ is neither finite nor countable. 
    \item $A$ is at most countable if $A$ is finite or countable.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Now for some examples. In particular, we will show the (possibly) surprising
result that sets of all integers, the set of only positive integers (which is
just $\N$), the set of even integers, and the set of odd integers all have the
same cardinality, the countably infinite kind.  That is to say, they all have
the same number of numbers in them.  We will do this by explicitly defining
bejective mappings between each set to $\N$.

\begin{example}
$\Z = \{\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$ is the set of all integers.
$\Z$ is countable, i.e. $\Z \sim \N$. The bijection $f:\N \rightarrow \Z$ is
given by the following
\[ 
f(n) =
\begin{cases} 
    \frac{n}{2}      & \text{if} \quad n \quad \text{is even} \\
    -\frac{n - 1}{2} & \text{if} \quad n \quad \text{is odd}
\end{cases}
\]
We can check that this is indeed a bijection between $\N$ and $\Z$.  To do so
we show that it is both a surjection and an injection. First, for any natural
number $y\in \Z$, if $y$ is positive, then we can find the the integer $x = 2y$
which is an even natural number, thus under the mapping,
\[
f(x) = f(2y) = \frac{2y}{2} = y
\]
If $x$ is not positive (so is 0 or is negative), then we can find the integer
$y = -2y + 1$, which is an odd natural number, therefore under the mapping,
\[
f(x) = f(-2y + 1) = -\frac{-2y + 1 - 1}{2} = -\frac{2y}{2} = y
\]
So any integer $y$ in $\Z$, we have found a natural number in $\N$ that is
mapped by $f$ to $y$, therefore $f$ is surjective.

Now for injectivity. Suppose we take two disitinct natural numbers, $x_1$ and
$x_2$, $x_1\neq x_2$. If they have different parities, then the mapping $f$
maps them to different signs, therefore $f(x_1)\neq f(x_2)$. If they are both
even, then since $x_1\neq x_2$, we must have $f(x_1) = \frac{x_1}{2}\neq
\frac{x_2}{2} = f(x_2)$. If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are both odd, then similarly we
have $f(x_1) = -\frac{x_1-1}{2}\neq -\frac{x_2-1}{2} = f(x_2)$. Therefore we
have established that $f$ is an injection. Since we showed both surjectivity
and injectivity, $f$ is a bijection. Therefore, by our definition of
cardinality, $\N$ and $\Z$ have the same cardinality, i.e. they have the same
number of elements.

The cases for finding a bijection between $mathbb{N}$ and the set of even
integers, and between $\N$ and odd integers, are left as excercises for you.
The general appraoch is the same as the case shown just now.
\end{example} 

\begin{remark}
Recall that a proper subset of a set $A$ is a subset of $A$ that is not the
whole of $A$.  It is not possible for a proper subset of a finite set to be
equivalent (same cardinality) to the set itself. This is intuitively apparent,
a subset that is not equal to the original set must have less elements.
However, if the original set is an infinite set, then this is possible. As we
have just shown, $\N \sim \Z$, but $\N$ is a proper subset of $\Z$.
\end{remark}
