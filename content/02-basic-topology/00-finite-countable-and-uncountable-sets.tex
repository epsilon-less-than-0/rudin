\section{Finite, Countable, and Uncountable Sets}\label{sec:finite-countable-and-uncountable-sets}

Armed with a well-constructed real number system, we can begin to talk about
some mathematical constructions. One of the simplest constructions 
(operations?) on the real numbers is the object called a function. A function
is simply a gadget that takes an input number and outputs a number that is
determined based on some rule associated to that specific function. 

However, note that the notion of a function is not
constrained to operating numbers. It can make as much sense to talk about a 
function on an arbitrary set, and the "outputs" need not even resemble the 
inputs in any shape or form. For example, one can define a function on the set
of names of people in a class, which outputs the birthday of the person in
binary.

It this case, we would call the set of names the domain of the function,
and
